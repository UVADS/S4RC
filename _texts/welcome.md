## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the S4RC website. This site serves as a hub for our research interest group focused on sustainable and secure scientific software and reproducible computing.

### What We Do

Our group meets regularly to discuss topics including:

1. **Best Practices in Scientific Software**
   - Code review processes
   - Testing strategies
   - Documentation approaches
   - Continuous integration

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Threat modeling for research environments
   - Secure data handling
   - Access control and authentication
   - Incident response planning

3. **Reproducibility Tools and Techniques**
   - Container technologies (Docker, Singularity)
   - Workflow systems (Snakemake, Nextflow)
   - Environment management (Conda, virtual environments)
   - Data management platforms

### Resources

We curate and share resources that help researchers improve their computational practices. This includes:
- Tutorials and guides
- Tool recommendations
- Case studies
- Links to relevant publications

### Community

S4RC is more than just a technical group—it's a community of practice. We believe that improving scientific software requires not just technical solutions but also cultural change in how we approach computational research.
