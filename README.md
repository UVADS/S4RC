**Research Interest Group: Sustainable &amp; Secure Scientific Software &amp; Reproducible Computing**

This Research Interest Group (RIG) focuses on best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining scientific computing software using modern containerization and orchestration tools. We aim to address a critical gap in academic research: ensuring that computational tools and pipelines are secure, reproducible, sustainable, and scalable across HPC environments, managed cloud services, and collaborative research teams.

## Why get involved?
Scientific discovery increasingly depends on complex computational tools, yet most academic software is developed in isolation, is poorly maintained, and prone to becoming “orphan-ware.” This RIG will bring together researchers, students, and developers to explore state-of-the-art practices in containerized scientific computing, including:

• Building, deploying, and securing containerized software.

• Orchestration strategies across HPC, cloud, and hybrid environments through modern tooling.

• Developing simpler deployment and management tools to foster greater adoption.

• Establishing guidelines for sustainable software development, packaging, and maintenance.

• Licensing, dependency management, and long-term project governance.

• Monitoring software usage and establishing criteria for when to sunset tools responsibly.

Through seminars, hands-on workshops, and collaborative tool-building, we will strengthen UVA’s capacity to produce high-impact, reproducible scientific software that scales to meet the demands of modern data science.

## How to Join
We welcome anyone interested in sustainable and secure scientific software development to join our RIG.
